# Builder Pattern Using Type level programming


This is an example of a builder pattern written in value level and type level 
programming using Scala.

In this application you'll find multiple examples, one is based on the type level where as the other is based on value level which is type safe.

_How to run the application?_

You need not use the SBT console to run the application, just press the run button
to run the application

_How to build the application?_

Since this being a SBT project you can use the sbt console to build the application

_Unit Testing_

I added a unit test class that tests the builders of each example, to run this just run the class suit

_Dependencies_

`libraryDependencies += "org.scalatest" % "scalatest_2.10" % "2.0" % "test"`

`libraryDependencies += "junit" % "junit" % "4.12" % Test`
